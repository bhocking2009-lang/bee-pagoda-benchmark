## Notes
- Original chat images are available in conversation context, but not automatically persisted as local files by default.
- To finalize physical assets in repo, add image files under `assets/brand/mockups/` using the filenames above.
- Once files are added, update this inventory with final chosen logo in `assets/brand/logo-candidates/`.

## Recommended next step
- Select 1 primary logo candidate + 1 fallback and place them in:
  - `assets/brand/logo-candidates/primary.*`
  - `assets/brand/logo-candidates/fallback.*`
